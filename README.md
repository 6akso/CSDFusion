# CSDFusion  
Updated on 14 Nov 2025

We are pleased to announce that our paper  
“CSDFusion: Continuous Knowledge Trajectories for Task-Driven Infrared and Visible Image Fusion” 
(Xianshuai Li)  
has been accepted by *Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS)*.

Since the paper has not yet been formally published online, we are not releasing the full codebase at this moment. Over the coming weeks, we will organize the project and gradually upload key components along with several pretrained models. Once the paper becomes officially available online, the complete code and all associated resources will be released in this repository.
